# Half-scale campaign maps

## What the GranaTV maps do

The reference video is [Trackmania, but the Maps are Shrinked!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlb0rwvvpkU). The maps are Everios96's `U10S TINY` campaigns in the Altered U10S club.

The files establish the implementation, rather than just the visual effect:

- the original `U10S_01` has 330 authored blocks and 152 items;
- `U10S_01 By Everios96 [Tiny]` has **zero authored blocks** and 119 items;
- its route is rebuilt from embedded custom `Tiny*.Item.Gbx` models;
- corresponding placement deltas are exactly halved (for example, the start-to-finish delta goes from `(384, 0, 96)` to `(192, 0, 48)` metres);
- the custom item placement scale remains `1.0`, so the geometry was scaled when each Item.Gbx was authored, not by changing a native block's placement;
- the baked stadium floor remains full size.

In short: native blocks are first converted to items, those item meshes are made half-size, and a second map is assembled with all route placement offsets multiplied by `0.5`.

## Rust automation

`tmmaps tiny` now requires a mapping for **every authored (unbaked) block** and scales every existing item. It refuses to emit a partial map. The baked/generated decoration remains the full-size foundation, matching the reference campaign's treatment of its baked Grass floor.

```text
tmmaps tiny SOURCE.Map.Gbx \
  --out SOURCE-Tiny.Map.Gbx \
  --mapping tiny/roadtech-half.tsv \
  --library tiny/roadtech-half-items.zip \
  --scale 0.5 \
  --anchor 1024,300,1024
```

For a directory containing a campaign:

```text
tmmaps tiny-batch Campaign/ \
  --out Campaign-Tiny/ \
  --mapping tiny/roadtech-half.tsv \
  --library tiny/roadtech-half-items.zip \
  --scale 0.5 \
  --anchor 1024,300,1024
```

The command:

1. finds the source map's block-carried spawn and uses it as the transform origin;
2. refuses unless every authored block model has an Item.Gbx mapping;
3. replaces all authored blocks with mapped item models and scales every existing item;
4. preserves every waypoint explicitly;
5. DELETES the original authored blocks and the generated (baked) non-foundation fillers from the block chunks — `MapFile::remove_blocks` re-serialises 0x0304301F and 0x03043048 with the shared lookback table re-encoded, and rewrites everything that lists blocks (0x0304305F free positions, 0x03043062 colours, 0x03043068 lightmap quality, 0x03043069 macroblock refs, the snapped-on tables of 0x03043040); the baked `Sea` records stay (the water); `--keep-zone-block` keeps ONE authored block for `tinyctl lightmap` (the editor's lightmap pass crashes on a map with none);
6. embeds the supplied converted-item archive;
7. assigns a distinct 27-byte map UID (`Tiny` + the first 23 source UID bytes);
8. reloads the written map and verifies every generated item model, position, scale, and waypoint tag.

The transformation is intentionally split into three write/reload stages. Item model renames change the GBX lookback table, while waypoint nodes and the embedded ZIP are variable-length records. Applying both against one set of offsets is unsafe.

## Current Summer 01 status

Summer 2026 - 01 contains 2,430 authored blocks, 1,704 existing items, and 2,214 baked/generated foundation blocks. The public converted-Nadeo archive provides exact Item.Gbx models for only 23 of the map's 46 distinct authored block models. The remaining 23 are mostly BlueBay terrain (`Land*`, `Beach`, `LandHill*`, `LandCliff12`) plus several support/decor variants.

The command therefore **refuses** Summer 01 today rather than silently dropping half the map. The earlier route-only artifact is not a complete conversion and should not be used as one. Once the 23 missing items are exported from the game, adding them to the mapping/library is enough; the all-object writer and its item-array growth path are implemented and tested.

## Triggers: what the engine reads from an embedded item (measured 2026-09-08)

Three facts, each paid for with a drive on the render box (tiny Summer 20,
full throttle from the spawn through the Boost gate, `tinyctl play --wheels-ms`):

1. **A gameplay gate's effect is an `NPlugTrigger_SGateSpecial` prefab entity
   (class 0x09179000: version 2, trigger shape ref, u32), nothing else.** The
   same slab written as the entity model's `TriggerShape` — with or without a
   material node, gameplay 1/12/18 — does nothing; in the collision hull as
   NotCollidable + gameplay it is a wall (physics 28 does not make hull
   triangles pass-through). So a special-gate item is written in the pack's
   own layout, `CGameItemModel -> CPlugPrefab { static object, SGateSpecial }`
   (`Merged::special`), and fires: 23.6 → 36.8 → 45.6 → 50.9 → 54.9 m/s past the
   gate where the original does 30 → 62.
2. **The effect id is the gate kind's `Modifier\<Kind>\Collision.Material.Gbx`**,
   chunk 0x09079017 = `{ v1, [physics, gameplay, u8, 0x80], f32, u32, string }`:
   Boost 18 (ReactorBoost_Oriented), NoEngine 4 (FreeWheeling), Reset 8; Turbo
   has no Collision file and the prefab's own slab bytes (physics 0, gameplay 1)
   stand. The id table entry is `physics | gameplay << 8`, as everywhere else.
   Item gates carry the slab in their prefab (`Special24m.Prefab.Gbx` entity 1,
   shape `Special_Trigger24m.Shape.Gbx`); BLOCK gates (GateSpecialBoost…) carry
   the disc inline in the block info (CPlugSolid → CPlugTree → a 68-triangle
   surface in `Effects\Media\Material\CollisionTurbo`), the prefab being the
   arch alone. `Reset.TerrainModifier .Gbx` is spelled with a space.
3. **Block waypoint triggers are Compound surfaces** (`Gate\Checkpoint_Trigger
   .Shape.Gbx`: one 36-vertex disc; the platform checkpoints a 0.1 m plane) and
   must be flattened (`Surf::triangulate`), or the bake falls back to the unit
   box and a finish fires on its whole 32 m cube. The item editor writes the
   same 36/68 disc for Granady's `Tiny_Ring1`.

## Trees: half-size static snapshots of the vegetation (2026-09-08)

A `VegetTreeModel` placement cannot be resized — the game instances the
species at its authored size — so until 2026-09-08 every source tree was
placed as a STOCK species one size class down and stood ~2× too tall beside
the half-size track ("the trees look really weird at double the size, can we
make a static model half the size?" — vjeux, after playtesting all 25).
`mapgeom tiny-library --veget bake` (the default) bakes every species the map
places as ONE half-scale static item, `AV%08d.Item.Gbx`, from the pack's
`.VegetTreeModel.Gbx` (`mapgeom veget-info PATH` prints one; all 193 species
files of the five collections decode), placed at the source position × 0.5
with the source yaw like every block: no stand-in species, no sink, and the
tree clearance judges baked trees for the census only (a half-size tree at a
half-size place meets a deck exactly when the original did).

What the bake keeps and what it gives up:

* **Kept**: every detail level's visuals at 0.5, under one item material per
  model material; the trunk hull as the collision (Wood); the model's own LOD
  switch distances, UNSCALED (a half-size tree switches where the full one
  did); `--lod-pick` applies like to blocks (level N alone, no ladder).
* **Materials**: the vegetation materials are inline (name + D/N/R images, no
  pack `.Material.Gbx`), so each becomes an item-editor custom material —
  `TDSN` for bark AND leaves, the pack's diffuse (DXT5 with alpha, mips cut to
  256 px a side) in user-texture slot 0, riding next to the items as
  `Items/<image>.dds`. Three facts cost a probe each: a visual without a
  TexCoord1 set is NOT DRAWN under any valid material (the pack leaf visuals
  carry uv0 alone → `ensure_texcoord1`); TDSN alpha-tests a diffuse that has
  an alpha channel while TDOSN/TDOBSN/TIAdd draw such cards invisible and
  TDOSN2Sided is not a model the item loader knows (red); custom materials of
  one NAME are one material to the game (thirteen palms whose `PalmTree_Leaf`
  differed only by model crashed the client at 0x140456513), so the name
  spells the model and the image (`TDSN_ItemPalmTreeBranch_D`).
* **Two-sided**: a reversed copy of every leaf triangle on the same vertices
  (`TINY_TREE_LEAF_BACKFACES=shared`; `flip` duplicates the vertices with
  reversed normals — no visible gain, +60 % leaf bytes).
* **Given up, stated once**: no wind animation (the vertex-colour wind weights
  are stripped), no impostor past the far distance (the last level is drawn
  at every distance), no placement-colour hue mask (the default look is baked
  — Summer 20's palms are placed Red, 10's Spring set Green; those tints are
  gone).
* **Count rule**: a species is baked only if it is ≥ 2 m tall AND carries a
  collision hull. Hull-less species (grass, ferns, BlueBay's JungleForestA/B/C
  — 7 m one-material trunkless cards the game instances by the tens of
  thousands) stay on the stock path exactly as before: tiny 01 is 5 255 item
  placements, not the 34 090 the first bake produced.
* **Known cosmetic limit — dynamic lights**: the item shading models answer
  local lights (stadium ShowLights rigs, the checkpoint gates' embedded
  lights) with a yellow-white glare the game's vegetation shader never shows;
  bushes standing inside a gate's beams (tiny 24, cp8) look like crumpled
  paper while the tall species escape because their crowns sit above the
  beams. Proven both ways — lights moved out of the box: the same bush goes
  from mean RGB (166,175,100) with 12.5 % blown pixels to (69,77,56) and 0 %;
  at source scale the glare is identical, so it is not a half-radius
  intensity artefact. Nothing material-side moves it (alpha clamps, constant
  textures in every slot, normal maps, vertex colours, back-face variants,
  every other model). Decision 2026-09-08: ship as is; the light itself is
  what is off (the road under those gates is too white in the tiny as well)
  and goes to a lights follow-up, not a tree workaround.

Sizes with `--lod-pick 1 --lod-pick-min-verts 2000`: 01 8.1 MB (5.9 without
trees), 20 13.8, 17 12.3, 24 25.4 (45 MB without the pick), 25 26.9, 21 29.2
(25.5 without trees; 28.3 with `TINY_TREE_TEX_MAX=128 TINY_TREE_LOD_MIN=1`).
Playground open time is unchanged within noise (01: 4.4 s with trees, 4.0 s
without; 20: 4.5 s; 17: 4.6 s).

## Particle effects: the small stock siblings (2026-09-08)

An embedded item cannot carry a live particle emitter in this build: the game
silently DROPS any item whose prefab has an FxSystem entity with a model —
geometry included, no dialog (sixteen one-item probes; `item-check` FX-03
refuses the form). So the foggers, sparklers and torches baked as static
machines with no smoke, sparks or flame — until vjeux asked "can we use a
smaller version of the fog machine so we still get the effect?", the flags'
trick (`Flag16m` → the stock `Flag8m`, whose cloth is the 16 m cloth at ×0.5).

Nadeo ships each particle item in a smaller version whose NAME is the effect's
REACH, not the machine's size, and `stock_half_variant` maps to it:

| source | stock stand-in | the machine | the effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ShowFogger16M` | `ShowFogger8M` | same 0.6 m wide box, 0.7 m long for 1.0 | plume carries 8 m for 16 |
| `ShowFoggerWithLight16m` | `ShowFoggerWithLight8m` | same, `FoggerSpot` light at the nozzle | same |
| `Sparkler16m` | `Sparkler8m` | 0.40 m box for 0.51 | sparks reach 8 m for 16 |
| `ShowTorch` | `ShowTorchSmall` | 1.64 m torch for 2.77 (fire at 0.97 m for 1.88) | `TorchSmoke` + `ItemTorchFlame` + `TorchLight`, the game's |
| `Show` variant 28 | `ShowFogger8M` | the generic show rig's fogger variant IS the `Fogger16M` prefab | as the fogger |

Placed as STOCK items (mapping row `model_scale = scale`, so the placement
stays at scale 1 with its pivot halved; the variant byte rewritten by an `iv@`
row where the source's indexes a different list) the game runs its own
particle systems for them: the half-reach effect on the half-size map for
free, no archive bytes (a map loses one embedded item per stand-in, ~20–30 KB).
Pivots need no correction — every pair shares the origin convention (fogger
base at y −0.088, sparkler base at 0, torch stake below 0), measured with
`mapgeom dump` / `mapgeom model … --out X.obj` on the pack prefabs.

The stand-in's NAME is the item file's header ident, case-exact, never the pack
path: `Stadium\Items\ShowFogger8M.Item.Gbx` says `ShowFogger8m` inside, and a
`ShowFogger8M` placement is silently DROPPED by the game (no dialog; the item
census the probe plugin writes after a load is the tell — `items=N` under the
file's placement count). `build` reads every stand-in's ident back from its file.

Verified in the editor on tiny 15 (22 foggers, 13 sparklers) against the
original from the same cameras at half distance: plumes and spark bursts at
the original spots, the machines on their decks, the same apparent size (=
half reach). Sparks are periodic bursts — repeat a view row under several
names to sample the animation; a single frame may miss them.

The FX family, surveyed on the pack (`mapgeom refs` over every `Show*`,
`Sparkler*`, `Torch*` item's prefabs): the emitters live ONLY in the eight
prefabs above (`Fogger16M/8M.FxSys`, `Sparkler16m/8m.FxSys`, `TorchSmoke.FxSys`
shared by both torches). `ShowLights`, `ShowScreen`, `ShowRace`, `ShowSpeakers`,
`ShowLight4Spots`, `ShowLightRamp*`, `ShowSpeaker*`, `ShowRig*` carry none —
nothing is lost baking them.

Given up: the maps' own `Sparkler8m` placements (168 over 03 06 10 19 20 21 24)
have no 4 m sibling and stay static, sparkless (`TINY_FX_SPARK8=stock` keeps
them as the stock item: live sparks at their full 8 m reach — an A/B knob).
The stock machine is the ORIGINAL's size, i.e. twice the relative size of a
baked half copy; at 0.6 m it reads as a small box beside a half-size car.
`TINY_FX_STOCK=0` bakes the family static as before.
