//! `gbx` — the TM2020 GBX file format, in one place.
//!
//! WHY THIS CRATE EXISTS. Three tools in this project used to carry their own
//! copy of this format: `tmtraj` (the trajectory decoder), `tools/ghost` (the
//! ghost/replay API) and `tmsite` (the visualiser). Two implementations of one
//! file format is how a project gets silent corruption — a fix lands in one
//! reader and the other keeps decoding the old way, and nothing fails. There is
//! now exactly one implementation and it is here; everything else calls it.
//!
//! The split of responsibility across the workspace:
//!
//! * **`gbx`** — what the bytes ARE. Container, chunks, the input tape, the
//!   `CPlugEntRecordData` telemetry record and the meaning of the 116-byte
//!   vehicle sample. Reads and writes; no verdicts, no analysis, no I/O beyond
//!   the file in front of it.
//! * **`tmtraj`** — what the bytes MEAN for a run: trajectory analysis,
//!   comparison between runs, the publish gate's physics checks, racing-line
//!   clustering. Read-only; it never writes a ghost.
//! * **`ghost`** — every MUTATION of a ghost or replay, plus the oracle and the
//!   publish decision.
//! * **`tmsite`** — presentation: the 3D page and the TICK input-script export.
