//! `tmtraj geom envelope` — what the ROUTE is worth, measured from the field's
//! own driving rather than from its lap times.
//!
//! WHY (arm `ksi2`, 134672, 2026-08-22)
//! ------------------------------------
//! The standing bound on 134672 is a sum of best SECTORS — five numbers on a
//! 67 s lap — and it says the route is worth 63.263 against an author time of
//! 58.687. Five numbers can only see a swap between whole sectors, and every
//! run in this field throws away time in a different place *inside* a sector.
//!
//! This module asks the same question at a 10 m grain, and it asks it in a
//! coordinate where the question is meaningful.
//!
//! **Arclength along a run's OWN path is not a place.** A run that spins or
//! loops travels further to reach the same point, so its "speed at 1500 m" is
//! a speed somewhere else entirely — four of this map's fifteen records have
//! paths 200-1200 m longer than the ribbon. So every sample is projected onto
//! one reference centreline first, and the speed that matters is
//! **d(reference arclength)/dt: how fast the run is getting down the route**,
//! which charges a detour for being a detour and charges a slide for nothing.
//!
//! Then two envelopes, and the difference between them is the point:
//!
//! * **raw** — the fastest anyone has ever gone through each 10 m of the
//!   route. Optimistic beyond achievability: it stitches together cars in
//!   states that cannot be reached from one another.
//! * **feasible** — the same envelope after a forward-backward pass under
//!   acceleration limits *measured from this field on this map*, so a bin
//!   cannot claim a speed the car could not have got to, or got away from.
//!
//! ## The control
//!
//! Both passes reduce, on one run's own data, to reconstructing that run's own
//! lap. `--self-control` does exactly that for each input file and prints the
//! reconstruction against the file's real time. A projection bug, an
//! integration bug or a wrong reference all show up there as a number that is
//! not the run's own time — and a bound whose instrument cannot reproduce a
//! known lap is not evidence about anything.

/// * **No faster than the car moved.** The advance in reference arclength is
///   capped at the distance the car actually travelled between the two
///   samples. You cannot get down a route faster than you move through space,
///   whatever the geometry says. Before this cap, a run momentarily nearest to
///   the next fold of the sausage projected metres forward for free, and the
///   envelope came out at 42 s — sixteen seconds under an author time that
///   nobody has ever approached. The acceleration table gave it away first:
///   5225 m/s².
///
/// `median_miss` reports how far this run sits from the reference line, which
/// is the number that says whether it is on this route at all.
/// Project one run onto the reference by **banded monotone alignment** (DTW).
///
/// Three greedy projections were tried first and all three failed a control:
///
/// * nearest-point with a wide window jumped to the next fold of the sausage
///   and bought free metres (envelope 41.5 s, acceleration table 5225 m/s²);
/// * nearest-point capped by the car's own displacement DEADLOCKED at a
///   hairpin, where the point nearest a car at the apex is on the leg it came
///   in on — every run in the field stalled at the same 500 m;
/// * a predictor-corrector lost lock and drifted 17-22 m off the line.
///
/// A greedy rule decides each sample from local information, and on a folded
/// route local information is ambiguous. The alignment is a global decision:
/// one monotone correspondence between the run's samples and the reference's,
/// minimising total distance, computed by dynamic programming. Monotone by
/// construction, and it cannot jump a fold because a jump makes the samples
/// on either side of it expensive.
///
/// The band keeps it O(n·w): a run and the reference are both driving the same
/// route, so the fraction of the route completed cannot differ from the
/// fraction of the run's own path completed by more than `BAND` metres of
/// reference. That is an assumption, and it is checked — `median_miss` says
/// how far the aligned pairs actually are apart, and a run that does not
