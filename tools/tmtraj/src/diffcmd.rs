//! `tmtraj diff` — are these two recordings the same run?
//!
//! One command for what used to be five: `sep`, `seplag`, `nearident`,
//! `recdiff` and `intg pair`. They asked overlapping questions with different
//! alignment rules, different tolerances and different failure behaviour, and
//! the differences were where the bugs lived.
//!
//! ## The one invariant
//!
//! **An empty denominator is not a measurement.** Every mode here reports how
//! many samples it actually compared, and refuses (exit 3, `UNMEASURED`) rather
//! than returning a verdict from nothing.
//!
//! This is not a hypothetical failure. `sep` used to walk two files index by
//! index and `break` on the first time-key mismatch, printing a note to stderr
//! that every pipeline discarded. Sample times are SESSION times, so two
//! recordings made in different sessions disagree at index 0: all ten of
//! 228607's published files were compared against `AUTHOR_LAP_20258`, produced
//! ZERO rows each, and the audit read ten silences as ten CLEAN verdicts.
//! `nearident` inherited the same shape and printed `VERDICT INDEPENDENT` with
//! an overlap of 0 and a mean of `f64::MAX`.
//!
//! ## What each mode proves, and what it does not
//!
//! * **`--at-shared-instants`** (default) — per-instant separation on the
//!   instants the two files share, plus which run is further along its own
//!   path. This is the number the two-car render test needs: a second car is
//!   only demonstrably DRAWN if there is a frame where the runs are far enough
//!   apart to be two cars and close enough that both are in one chase camera.
//!   "Not drawn" and "out of frame" are indistinguishable without it.
//!
//! * **`--lag`** — the same comparison with the time labels IGNORED, scanned
//!   over every integer sample offset. Use it when the grids do not line up.
//!   A donor graft shows as a long run of exactly-zero distances at some lag.
//!
//! * **`--near`** — the same scan at a millimetre band instead of exact
//!   equality, because a copy that has been through a float re-encode is never
//!   bit-identical. **It requires `--control`** and refuses without one: on
//!   199100 the exact test returned "INDEPENDENT — no identical position at any
//!   lag" for a pair that is one run (mean 0.000476 m over 800 samples,
//!   byte-identical input tapes), and a fixed 1 mm band then cried COPY on four
//!   clips that were fine, because 1 mm is TWICE our own writer's noise floor
//!   (0.482 / 0.483 / 0.489 / 0.518 mm against the game's own recording on four
//!   maps). The verdict is a RATIO against a pair known to be two different
//!   runs on this map — dimensionless, and untunable. Human against human is
//!   the pairing that works: neither can have come out of our pipeline.
//!
//! * **`--bytes`** — per-byte agreement of the raw 116-byte samples. Two ghosts
//!   that encode different runs must not carry the same recorded motion; before
//!   this test existed, 17 of the repo's 29 multi-ghost maps did, which is why
//!   two of our own tapes once rendered as a single car.
//!
//! ## What a shared prefix does NOT prove
//!
//! Nothing. The simulation is deterministic, so two tapes with the same opening
//! inputs give identical f32 positions for as long as their inputs agree — our
//! own sibling tapes are 67 % bit-identical on one 203072 pair. The proof of a
//! splice is RE-CONVERGENCE: identical, then more than `--minsep` apart, then
//! exactly identical again. Driving cannot do that. `tmtraj gate` reads the
//! runs this command prints and applies that rule.

const INPUTS_USAGE: &str = "\
usage: tmtraj inputs GHOST [--csv FILE] [--events]

The steer / gas / brake the car was being given, recovered EXACTLY from bytes
14, 15 and 18 of every 50 ms telemetry sample. No input chunk, no engine.

  --events   only the samples where an input changed
  --csv F    write the table to F

Why this is exact and why that matters: byte 14 is
`floor((steer_i8 + 127) * 255 / 254)`, measured against the corpus, and the map
is injective — so the tape value is recoverable, not approximable. This crate
used to decode byte 14 as the float ((v/255) - 0.5) * 2 and every comparison
against a tape then needed a +-1 slop, which is precisely wide enough to hide a
`round`-instead-of-`floor` encoder error. Finding that error took one
verification statistic from a Cohen's kappa of 0.467 to 1.000.

An UNREACHABLE byte is reported, never rounded to the nearest legal value: a
byte 14 no steer value can produce was not written by the game recording a car
being steered, and that is a finding.

CAVEAT, and do not let it be forgotten: this is what the RECORD says the car
was given. It is a 50 ms resampling of a 10 ms channel, so it is not an input
count -- six README-stated counts were once checked against telemetry and all
six were wrong (14->17, 23->16, 19->16, 15->59, 2->523, 3->1753). For what the
driver pressed, read the input chunk: `ghost tape extract`.
