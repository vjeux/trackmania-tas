//! `tmtraj` — read-only analysis of a Trackmania 2020 run.

//! It never writes a ghost. The file format lives in `gbx`; every mutation
//! lives in `ghost`. What is here is the layer above the bytes: what a
//! trajectory says the car did, whether two recordings are the same run, and
//! whether a file is a physically coherent run of a car.

/// Internals this crate's own integration tests reach into. **Not an API.**
///
/// Every other module is `pub(crate)` on purpose: `pub` switches off the
/// dead-code warning, and that is how a crate accretes sixty commands and
/// nobody notices forty of them stopped being called. Making the dispatcher a
/// library entry point (`run`) and everything else crate-private turned the
/// compiler back into the dead-code detector, which found eighteen unreachable
/// functions and structs on the first build — including three that had been
/// documented in the README as if they were live.
///
/// An integration test is a separate crate, so it cannot see `pub(crate)`.
/// Named items only, never a whole module, except `lines` and `stats`, whose
/// golden suites walk most of their surface.
