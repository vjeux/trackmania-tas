//! `tmtraj intg` -- GHOST INTEGRITY: is this file's telemetry its own?
//!
//! THE TEST
//! --------
//! A shared bit-identical PREFIX between two runs proves nothing. The
//! simulation is deterministic, so two tapes with the same opening inputs give
//! identical f32 positions for as long as their inputs agree, and our own
//! sibling tapes do this routinely (67 % of samples on one 203072 pair).
//!
//! The proof is RE-CONVERGENCE. Once two runs are metres apart they are
//! different physical states, and no input sequence returns them to EXACTLY
//! 0.000000 m -- the same f32 bits in all three components. So the sequence
//!
//! ```text
//! bit-identical  ->  diverge past a threshold  ->  bit-identical again
//! ```
//!
//! cannot be produced by driving. It is a splice: two runs' samples in one
//! record. That is what a partially-regenerated ghost is.
//!
//! WHAT THE VERDICT IS WORTH
//! -------------------------
//! CONTAMINATED is a positive finding and it is reference-free in the sense
//! that it needs no model -- but WHICH reference matters. Against a HUMAN
//! recording the finding is clean. Against one of our own siblings it is not,
//! because two of our own files can re-converge for the honest reason that they
//! share the contaminating pipeline: both inherited the same donor's samples in
//! the same places. `--kind` labels the reference so the audit can keep the two
//! populations apart, and this command never merges them.
//!
//! CLEAN here means "no splice against THIS reference". It is not a
//! certificate; the NO-REFERENCE case is reported as its own verdict and must
//! never be collapsed into CLEAN.

// ===========================================================================
// `intg gate` -- THE PUBLISH GATE. One command, exits non-zero, run BEFORE a
// ghost reaches a README.
//
// Every quality instrument this project owns was built after the artefacts it
// should have gated: `tmtraj check` was written the day ~170 ghosts were
// already published, and the re-convergence test an hour after that. That
// ordering is the defect this command exists to end.
//
// Three independent families, and a file must clear all three:
//
//   A. THE C-CHECKS (upstream `tmtraj check`) -- the file against itself and
//      the map: finite, moves, no teleport, no post-finish tail, the contact
//      and surface fields against free fall, the wheels, the input echo.
//
//   B. CONTAMINATION -- the bit-exact re-convergence test, against every human
//      recording we hold for the map. Identical -> metres apart -> identical
//      again cannot be driven, only spliced.
//
//   C. THE ORACLE -- the dedicated server re-simulating THE WRITTEN FILE and
//      returning the declared time. Not the tape it was built from: the file
//      that would be published, as it sits on disk.
//
// SANCTIONED EXCEPTIONS. A gate that refuses genuine files teaches people to
// override gates, so the narrow, named withdrawals are honoured -- and every
// application is LOGGED by name, so the exceptions are visible in the record
// rather than folded into a pass:
//
//   * lone C5  -- ground contact ON while provably airborne; the carrier's
//     byte on the two untitled ghosts, a known withdrawal.
//   * lone C10 -- the contact byte's flight claim; understood and unfixed.
//   * lone C8 ONLY when the file passes C8b below.
//
// Any second finding alongside an exception refuses. Any other failure
// refuses. Keep this list exactly this narrow.
//
// C8b -- WHY C8 AS WRITTEN REFUSES GENUINE FILES. Upstream C8 asks what share
// of a file's rolling steps imply a radius in 0.30..0.45 m. That band is the
// STADIUM car's wheel. On a snow map the car is swapped by the gameplay items
// and its wheel is 0.4700 m -- measured twice from opposite directions, on a
// downloaded Nadeo recording that re-simulates to its own exact millisecond,
// and by locating the wheel block in engine memory (0.4701 m). So the band is
// an automatic refusal on every non-Stadium car: snow, desert, rally. Same
// family as the free-fall constant that was carried at -22.3 for weeks.
//
// C8b measures the radius PER FILE and tests CONSISTENCY -- does the wheel
// behave like a wheel of SOME fixed size -- instead of equality with a
// constant. A foreign wheel byte-set still fails it: those bytes turn to
// another run's motion, so paired with THIS file's positions they imply no
// consistent radius at all.

C10, and a LONE C8 whose file passes C8b (a consistent wheel of any size --
0.36 m is the Stadium car's, a snow car is 0.4700 m). Anything else refuses.

// `intg dup` -- THE CROSS-FILE CHECK. No per-file gate can see this class.
//
// The corpus pass produced four 227654 ghosts that were each internally
// flawless -- 365 of 365 samples written, nothing missing in the race, the
// oracle exact, every C-check passing -- and all four carried ONE trajectory,
// bit-identical to each other at median, p90, p99 and max. Coverage, oracle
// agreement, tape md5 and C1..C10 are all properties of a SINGLE file, so
// every one of them passed. Only a comparison BETWEEN outputs can see it.
//
// The rule needs both halves:
//
//   identical telemetry + DIFFERENT inputs  -> REFUSE. Two different drives
//       cannot produce the same trajectory; one of them is the other's.
//   identical telemetry + IDENTICAL inputs  -> correct, and must not be
//       refused. 227654's TAS_57493 and TAS_57498 have the same inputs inside
//       the recorded window, so one trajectory is the right answer for both.
//       A naive "no two files may match" rule condemns them.
//
// So the comparison is against the INPUT ARCHIVE, never the telemetry alone.
// The input key used here is the validator's own decoded `Inputs` string --
// the engine's account of what it simulated, which is exactly the thing that
// has to differ for the telemetry to differ. Without a map to run the oracle
// on, the pair is reported as INPUTS-UNCHECKED and never as a pass.
//
// Why this happens, which is the part that constrains regeneration generally:
// the chooser identifies the car by grading candidates against the template's
// OWN recorded positions. On a contaminated file that record is the donor's,
// and all five 227654 files share one donor -- so it picks the donor's object
// every time and emits one trajectory every time. THE VERY CONDITION THAT
// MAKES A FILE WORTH REGENERATING IS THE CONDITION THAT MAKES THE CHOOSER
// UNSAFE. (`FK_NO_CHOOSER=1` is the enforcement upstream.)

// recorded instant, which is right when both files descend from the same
// carrier -- that is how the whole-file donor copies were found. It is USELESS
// against an independent recording: a ghost's sample times are SESSION times,
// not race times, so 227654's rank-2 human recording labels its samples
// 93680.. while our files label theirs 1310.. . Zero instants in common, and
// the honest verdict is NO-COMPARISON, not CLEAN. Nine files came back that
// way and none of them was tested by it.
//
// This is the reference-free form, and it is the rule the `nan` arm arrived at
// from the other direction: DO NOT ASK WHETHER TWO RUNS ARE CLOSE, ASK WHETHER
// ONE IS THE OTHER, SHIFTED. Slide the file along the reference over every
// integer sample lag and count BIT-IDENTICAL positions. A copy of another run
// -- however its timestamps were relabelled -- lands on a lag where the count
// is large. Two genuinely different drives never do: the same twelve f32 bytes
// by coincidence, repeatedly, does not happen.
//
// It costs O(n*m) position compares, which for 365 x 8550 is nothing.

// C3b -- IS THAT JUMP A TELEPORT, OR IS THE CAR SIMPLY FAST?

// distribution. On a map where the car is genuinely fast that is a false
// refusal: 126859's biggest step implies 223.7 m/s and the car's own
// speedometer reads 223.4 m/s -- 805 km/h on a Kacky map, and entirely real.
// A bar in metres cannot tell "fast" from "moved without travelling".
//
// The file already carries the answer. Every sample has the engine's own
// recorded speed, so compare the displacement the positions imply with the
// speed the car says it had:
//
//   ratio ~ 1.00                real driving, at any speed
//   recorded speed exactly 0.0  a RESPAWN -- normal gameplay, and the whole
//                               point of a Trial map (267460, 238835, 286279,
//                               186935 are all Trial-shaped)

//                               implied against 19.2 recorded)
//
// THE SPEEDOMETER IS NOT ALWAYS ZEROED ON A RESPAWN -- on at least one file it
// holds its pre-respawn value, so a rule that only tests "speed == 0" misses
// it and calls a respawn a splice. The robust discriminator needs no speed at
// all: after a respawn the car RESUMES DRIVING from where it landed, so the
// steps in the second following the jump are ordinary. After a splice the
// record simply continues in another run, and the jump is one discontinuity
// in a stream that was never interrupted. So: measure the jump against the

// STRUCTURAL TEST: the stale one is finite, moves, is self-consistent
// (d(pos)/dt matches the velocity stored beside it), has a unit quaternion,
// re-simulates to the exact declared millisecond, and is 100 % covered. A
// regeneration that locks onto it produces a file that passes coverage, the
// oracle, the manifest, C2 AND the contamination test, and is still wrong.
//
// Measured on three unrelated maps in one pass tonight -- 285268, 249521 and
// 227969 -- each 10.0 ms from its published copy to three digits, with the
// regeneration BEHIND on 100 % of samples.
//
// The discriminator is the `nan` arm's and it needs no reference recording:
// A BUFFER HOLDS THE PAST, so the live copy is the one FURTHEST ALONG ITS OWN
// VELOCITY at the same clock value. Project (this - other) onto the car's
// velocity: consistently negative means this file is the stale one.
//
// WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM THE CONTAMINATION TEST. That test asks whose run
// this is; this asks which copy of our own run it is. A stale file is our
// driving, correct in every claim the page makes, displayed 10 ms late -- so
// this is a REFUSAL for a file we are about to write, and NOT a reason to

// `intg poison` -- THE DECLARED-TIME DETECTOR. One field, no simulation.
//
// A synthesised tape carries its TEMPLATE's telemetry, and the header's
// declared time comes with it. So a file whose DECLARED time is some other
// run's time, while its filename (and its tape) say ours, is carrying somebody
// else's record. Found in the store as `203330/best/an330_13984.Ghost.Gbx`:
// declares 14018 -- the human WR's time -- with 281 samples byte-identical to
// that WR, while the repo's copy of the same run declares 13984 with 280
// samples of its own telemetry. Same input tape in both.
//
// This costs one header read. It is the cheapest instrument in the set and it
// catches the poisoning AT INGEST, where every other check we have needs the
// file to reach publication first.
//
// It is a NECESSARY condition, not a sufficient one: a poisoned file whose
// donor happened to run the same time would pass. Pair it with the
// contamination test, which is the sufficient one and costs a reference.
// ===========================================================================


// ===========================================================================
// `intg selfsim` -- IS THIS TELEMETRY THIS CAR'S? (the `csvcmp` requirement)
//
// The strongest of the three screens, and the one the other two cannot reach.
// It compares a ghost's RECORDED telemetry against a live re-simulation of
// THAT SAME TAPE's own inputs. For a real recording the two are the same
// object and must agree to the noise floor: a downloaded human control reads
// 0.000407 m median. A tape carrying its TEMPLATE's telemetry reads metres --
// 19.271 m median, 138.8 m max on 146612 -- because the recorded block belongs
// to the graft carrier, not to the run the inputs describe.
//
// It is the one quantity a transplanted telemetry block cannot fake, and it
// passes nothing else: on that map `nan gate` said PASS on all five gates and
// `tail scan` returned statistics identical to the human control TO FOUR
// DECIMALS.
//
// Implemented here on top of `fk clean`, which is what this workspace has:
// clean runs the tape as an ordinary validation and samples the engine's own
// state per tick, so its positions ARE the re-simulated route.
//
// THE CONTROL IS MANDATORY AND MUST RUN IN THE SAME BATCH. My own attempt at
// this measurement earlier tonight read 12 m on a known-good file, and the
// only reason I did not report a clean corpus as contaminated is that I ran a
// downloaded human ghost through the identical procedure and it read 11.96 m
// too. A number from this command means nothing without its control.
// ===========================================================================


// ===========================================================================
// C11b -- WHICH of the three telemetry defects is this?
//
// C11 compares a ghost's stored telemetry against the route re-simulated from
// its own inputs and refuses above 0.01 m. That bar cannot separate two
// defects whose consequences are OPPOSITE, because one is speed-dependent and
// the other is not:
//
//   own telemetry      < 0.001 m                     publish
//   STALE BUFFER       exactly speed x 0.010 m       refuse to WRITE; do NOT
//                                                    withdraw what is published
//   TEMPLATE POISONING metres to hundreds, no tick   withdraw
//
// On a slow map one tick is 5 cm and passes the bar; on a fast map it is 0.5 m
// and reads as poisoning. Measured: 267460's published file reads 0.487 m
// against its own route -- which C11 calls FOREIGN-TELEMETRY -- at a median
// speed of 39.92 m/s, so the implied offset is 10.024 ms over 236 samples.
// One tick. Our car, our run, displayed 10 ms late; the real 267460 poisoning
// that forced a withdrawal read 17.05 m median and 53.19 m max, forty times
// larger and not a whole tick.
//
// So divide by the car's OWN SPEED and ask whether the answer is a tick. That
// turns a threshold into a test of identity -- the same move as replacing the
// velocity projection with bit-equality at lag 1.
//
// The verdict text names which of the three it found, because
// "FOREIGN-TELEMETRY" on a stale file is a verdict that costs a withdrawal.
// ===========================================================================








// ===========================================================================
// COVERAGE ACCOUNTING FOR NEGATIVE-RETURNING TOOLS.
//
// Tonight's largest bug hid in exactly this gap: `locate_candidates` had
// `take(64)` on its shortlist, dropped 6161 of 6637 addresses WITHOUT PROBING
// THEM, and reported `0 passing` as though it had looked. Four hypotheses were
// burned before anyone counted.
//
// Every tool here that can return a negative -- the triage sampler, the lag
// scan, the poison sweep -- has the same shape, so each now reports what it
// EXAMINED beside what it FOUND, and a zero finding with a nonzero drop count
// is a hard error naming the knob rather than a clean-looking result.
//
// The abort path is instrumented too, and that is the half people forget: a
// tool that produces NOTHING and a tool that produces the WRONG THING are both
// silent failures, and the first is worse because it reads as bad luck. On
// 227654 four of five regenerations produced no file at all, and a retry loop
// would have turned that 50 % failure rate into a 100 % ship rate with no
// signal whatsoever.
// ===========================================================================

// THE HOLE THIS FILLS. Every contamination test here keys on BIT-EQUALITY --
// `pair`, `lag`, `dup` -- which is what makes them free of thresholds and is
// also a precise blind spot: A NEAR-COPY DEFEATS THEM ALL. A file 0.9 mm from
// the human recording is not bit-identical to it, so all three say CLEAN.
//

// contamination and the oracle, and sits **0.0009 m** from ailiei.'s 147.031

// inputs part at 3.050 s and stay nine tenths of a millimetre apart for the
// next sixteen seconds is not physics. It is the 0.494 mm shadow class, at the
// same order of magnitude.
//
// The fix is NOT to loosen the exact tests -- that reintroduces every threshold
// problem the night has been about. It is to ask the physics question that

// Staying together is the anomaly, and it needs no threshold on "how close is
