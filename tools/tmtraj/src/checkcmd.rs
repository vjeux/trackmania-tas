//! `tmtraj check` -- THE REFUSE-TO-PUBLISH CHECK.
//!
//! One command, run on a ghost before it leaves anybody's hands. It answers a
//! single question: **does this file's telemetry belong to this file's run?**
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS
//! -------------
//! Every defect this project has shipped had the same shape. A ghost is a tape
//! plus a recorded trajectory, and they are separate payloads that can disagree
//! completely: the oracle reads the tape, a video reads the record. So a file
//! can validate to the exact millisecond four different ways and still play
//! back as a stranger driving another map. It has happened, repeatedly:
//!
//!   * a carrier's whole trajectory, published under our lap time;
//!   * a non-finite position that every gate passed, because `err > tol` is
//!     false for NaN and so ACCEPTS it;
//!   * fourteen files whose car never moved, whose own results table recorded
//!     `moved_m = 0.0000` and nobody read it;
//!   * a carrier's post-finish tail teleporting the car 868 m after the line;
//!   * and the one a viewer finally noticed: dirt thrown up in mid-air.
//!
//! Each was found by a different ad-hoc investigation, after publication. This
//! is those investigations as one gate, run before.
//!
//! WHAT IT CANNOT DO
//! -----------------
//! It cannot prove telemetry is right. It proves a file is not obviously
//! somebody else's, and every check is a relationship the file must satisfy
//! against ITSELF or against the map -- no reference recording, so it runs
//! anywhere on anything. A PASS means "no known defect"; it never means
//! "verified".
