//! `tmtraj adjudicate` — does a file's own record match what the engine does
//! with that file's own tape?
//!
//! This settles the `corpus dup` verdict `UNRESOLVED-INERT-OR-SPLICE`. Two
//! published files hold bit-identical positions across a stretch where their
//! input tapes disagree, and there are two explanations with opposite meanings:
//!
//!   (a) the differing inputs had NO AUTHORITY there — countdown, wedge,
//!       ballistic flight, a `SpecialNoSteering` road. Innocent.
//!   (b) one file is CARRYING THE OTHER'S RECORDING for that stretch. A defect.
//!
//! ## The test, and why it does not depend on the locate being perfect
//!
//! Re-simulate **both** tapes through the real engine (`fk trace`) and ask
//! whether the two SIMULATIONS differ over the window where the two RECORDS
//! agree.
//!
//! * simulations differ, records identical  ⇒ **at most one record is right**,
//!   so at least one file carries a trajectory that is not its own tape's. A
//!   defect, and it does not matter which copy of the car the locate picked,
//!   because both traces came from the same instrument on the same map.
//! * simulations agree too ⇒ the inputs really were inert there. Innocent, and
//!   now MEASURED rather than assumed.
//!
//! That framing is deliberate. An absolute comparison (trace vs record) is at
//! the mercy of which copy of the car `fk` located — and ~0.5 mm of
//! disagreement is exactly what a wrong copy looks like, which is the defect
//! this project spent 2026-08-22 discovering. A **differential** comparison
//! between two traces from the same instrument cancels that: a wrong copy is
//! wrong the same way in both.
//!
//! ## ONE TRACE IS NOT ENOUGH, and this cost a false accusation
//!
//! A single trace disagreeing with its own file's record is a statement about
//! **that trace**, not about the file. Measured here on 2026-08-22:
//!
//! ```text
//! 173636 TAS_22072, fork tick 400   worst 0.3002 m, median 0.2415 m   "does NOT match"
//! 173636 TAS_22072, fork tick 700   worst 0.3002 m, median 0.2520 m   "does NOT match"
//! 173636 TAS_22072, fork tick 1000  worst 0.0008 m, median 0.0005 m   MATCHES
//! ```
//!
//! Same file, same map, same binary — three fork points, and two of them found
//! an object that is not the car. **Two agreeing wrong answers**, which is the
//! reproduction-count trap this project has hit before: a majority must never
//! outrank a test that can identify the answer.
//!
//! So the acceptance rule is: **sweep fork ticks and take the BEST agreement**,
//! and only call a record foreign when *no* fork point reproduces it. A file
//! that matches at any fork tick has been shown to be its own tape's run; a
//! file that matches at none is either foreign or a map the locate cannot do,
//! and those two are separated by whether the *other* files on the same map
//! locate cleanly.
