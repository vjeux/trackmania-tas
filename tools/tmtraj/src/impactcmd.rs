//! `tmtraj impacts` -- the collision census: where a run loses speed in one
//! sample, and by how much.
//!
//! This exists because "the car keeps banging off the edges — did we leave a
//! debug collision in?" is a question about a video, and a video cannot answer
//! it. Three facts turn it into a measurement:
//!
//! 1. **A MediaTracker render runs no physics.** It plays a recorded
//!    trajectory back. So whatever the clip shows is in the telemetry, and the
//!    question is whether the TELEMETRY's impacts are the engine's.
//! 2. **An impact has a signature the record carries**: the car's own recorded
//!    speed drops by more than a bar in a single 50 ms sample. That is the
//!    definition 134672's own analysis used to order the whole leaderboard —
//!    rank 2 and the previous best TAS have zero, the back half of the field
//!    six to eight — so it is not invented here.
//! 3. **Two independent regenerations of one tape are two readings of the same
//!    engine.** Each one locates the car in a fresh process and samples its
//!    state; they share no address, no run and no day. If both report the same
//!    impacts at the same milliseconds, the impacts are what the engine did.
//!
//! `--against` does exactly that comparison and prints the matched pairs, so a
//! disagreement names the millisecond rather than the file.
//!
//! Speeds print in km/h because that is the unit the car's own dashboard and
//! this project's collision bar are in.
