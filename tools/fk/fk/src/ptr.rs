//! THE STRUCTURE THAT OWNS THE VEHICLE STATE — finding it, and dereferencing it.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate finds the car by SEARCHING: a window of engine
//! memory is streamed to disk at every instant of a run and then swept for a
//! float triple that matches a position the file already knows. That is a
//! search for something with one right answer, and it costs 1.36 GB of disk and
//! eleven minutes per regeneration.
//!
//! The engine holds a POINTER to the car. This module finds it, and once found
//! a regeneration reads a pointer, dereferences it and gathers 864 bytes.
//!
//! # How it is found, and why the method cannot fool itself
//!
//! One engine run, stopped at the shim's handover, gives two things at once:
//! a **snapshot** of every writable mapping in the server ([`Snapshot::take`],
//! taken while the process is halted, so nothing is torn), and — after the run
//! finishes — **the address of the car**, identified the way `fk carrier` and
//! `gather_fields` already identify it: the copy whose position triple
//! reproduces the recording's own path to a micron AND whose four wheel slots
//! hold live floats. The snapshot is then walked BACKWARDS from that address
//! ([`Snapshot::chains_to`]): every 8-byte slot holding a pointer into the
//! vehicle struct, then every slot pointing at one of those slots, and so on,
//! until a slot lands in the game binary's own writable data — a **static**
//! address, `module + X`, which is the thing a future run can dereference.
//!
//! The scan is an equality test over a snapshot, so it has no threshold to
//! tune and no ranking to trust. What it does have is a coverage question — "no
//! pointer" could mean "no pointer" or "not scanned" — and that is what
//! [`Snapshot::recall_control`] answers: it draws slots that DO hold pointers,
//! hides their values, and asks the same scan to find them again. A negative is
//! only a negative next to that number.

/// and the position triple `CARRIER.md` anchors on is `state + 0x50`.
///
/// **The root is a singleton.** `module + 0x1e45148` is written by exactly one

/// under it. The array holds four vehicle objects at a stride of 0x1e08, and
/// the same four appear in a second array elsewhere on the heap.
///
/// **TWO VIS STATES PER OBJECT, AND THIS IS THE PART THAT WAS NEARLY MISSED.**
/// Each vehicle object carries two `CSceneVehicleVisState`s, at `+0x46c` and
/// `+0x848`. On a downloaded recording they hold the same state to a micron, so
/// the first version of this chain named `+0x848` and passed everything put to
/// it: three maps, six processes, byte-identical regenerations. On a
/// TRANSPLANTED container — a published TAS ghost whose telemetry record is a
/// stranger's — they separate. **`+0x46c` follows the tape the engine is
/// simulating; `+0x848` follows the record the file carries, 978 m away.** The
/// acceptance refused it and the run fell back to the blind window, which is
/// the system working — but a chain that is right on every file where the
/// record IS the run is not thereby a chain to the car, and only the one file
/// where the two differ could say so.
///
/// Measured with `+0x46c`, four runs of a recording and four of the transplant:
/// the pointer resolved on 7 of 8 (the eighth fell back, and the blind window
/// then failed too — that map's own 1-in-8 decoy rate) and **every file it
/// wrote is byte-identical to the blind window's**. Offering both members
/// instead makes the choice nondeterministic — one run in six picked `+0x848`,
/// which also qualified there, and wrote different bytes — so the default names
/// the simulation's state alone and the comma form stays for calibrating a new
/// build, where the two have to be compared before one is chosen.
///
/// Three other roots reach the same array on all three maps and are kept here
/// because a second witness is what makes the first one a measurement:

/// perfectly reproducible and still be built on nothing.
///
/// This is a CALIBRATION, not a law: another build moves every number in it.
/// Nothing trusts it. Every consumer resolves it and then applies the same
