//! fields (`template map server work shim csv tick ckpt tol mode out every n
//! addr span len tape difftick obs obstag steerdiv diffmag nth`) parsed by one
//! function, of which any given command read four or five. `--obstag` was
//! accepted by the memory-poker; `--difftick` by the tape cutter. A flag being
//! accepted said nothing about whether it did anything, and the only way to
//! find out was to read the command's body.
//!
//! What is actually shared is small and it is all here: which engine, which
//! map, which tape, where to work, and where to stop. Everything else is an
//! argument to one command and is parsed by that command.
