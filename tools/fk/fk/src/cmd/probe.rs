//! `fk probe` — find a named channel in the car's memory by matching it
//! against a recording that already knows the answer.
//!
//! The per-tick readout this driver ships gathers 44 bytes: the clock, the
//! quaternion, the position and the velocity. That is a decision somebody
//! made, not a limit — the engine computes far more than that and the game's
//! own recording carries 116 bytes per sample. Anything in the telemetry
//! record exists somewhere in the process; the question is only where.
//!
//! So this asks the question the cheap way round. Gather a WIDE window around
//! the located car, take the recording's own series for the channel you want,
//! and report every offset in the window whose bytes reproduce it. It is a
//! search with a ground-truth answer key, so it cannot talk itself into a
//! wrong answer the way a self-consistency argument can — and the tell that it
//! has found something real rather than a coincidence is UNIQUENESS plus a
//! decoding that is exact rather than merely correlated.
//!
//! Two traps this is shaped around, both of which cost this project time
//! before:
//!
//! * **A channel that barely varies matches everywhere.** A byte that is 0 for
//!   90 % of a run is reproduced by any other mostly-zero byte, so the report
//!   states the reference's own variation and refuses to rank anything when
//!   there is not enough of it.
//! * **A resumed fork is not the same run.** `fk trace`'s own header says so.
//!   The comparison is therefore on the ticks the fork actually simulated, in
//!   race time, and never row against row.
