//! `fk liveness` — is this anchor the copy of the car that has the fields?
//!
//! The engine keeps several copies of the vehicle state. They hold the same
//! position and pass every structural test a locator can apply — unit
//! quaternion, velocity equal to the position's derivative — but only one of
//! them has the surrounding fields alive. The others are bare position copies
//! with dead memory around them, and a regeneration anchored on one of those
//! writes zeroed wheel rotations and gear into a file that passes the whole
//! acceptance gate, because none of those bytes affects the simulation.
//!
//! So this asks the question that needs no answer key: at the four wheel-record
//! slots, do the rotation floats MOVE? Four live against four dead, nothing in
//! between. It is a property of the copy, not of the run, and it costs one
//! fork.
//!
//! Offsets are given relative to THIS driver's anchor — `Layout::pos`, the
//! address the locator returns. The carrier-bytes table published by the
//! byte-naming arm is relative to the live-wheeled copy's position triple,
//! which on this fixture sits 408 bytes above; its `car + 88 + 44k` is this
//! anchor's `car + 496 + 44k`.
