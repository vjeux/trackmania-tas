//! `fk server` — start a fork server, and prove it is telling the truth.
//!
//! Three verbs, and they are three different questions:
//!
//! * `probe` — *where did this server actually stop?* Cheap (about 2 s), so the
//!   load studies can run it hundreds of times.
//! * `check` — *does a resume give the same answer as a full validation?* This
//!   is THE control for the whole crate and it is the acceptance test for any
//!   new map or fork configuration.
//! * `bench` — *how much faster is it?* Against a BATCHED baseline, because
//!   nearly all of a validation's cost is the server launch.
//!
//! The old surface was `fk fs --mode auto|edge|test|bench|cal|scan` plus a
//! separate `fk fsprobe`: six modes behind one flag, three of which
//! (`test`, `cal`, `scan`) were subsets of `auto` reachable only by reading the
//! source. They are gone; `check` does what `auto` did, and its boundary sweep
//! is what `edge` and `cal` did.

///    resume that rewrites an already-consumed record is a silent no-op that
///    scores exactly the incumbent's score, so `delta == 0` is accepted and
