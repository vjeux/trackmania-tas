//! `fk trace` — one fork, one per-tick trajectory.
//!
//! The fork server runs a candidate 4–6× faster than a from-scratch validation,
//! but on its own it only ever reported a finish time. This turns the same fork
//! into an observation: while the child simulates the tail it streams the car's
//! own state out tick by tick, and the driver writes it in the same 29 columns
//! `tmtraj decode --csv` produces, so every existing analysis tool works on it
//! unchanged.
//!
//! # This is a RESUMED run, and that is not the same run
//!
//! `fk trace` forks at a checkpoint. Measured on this engine: the same tape
//! resumed at two different checkpoints agrees on **0 of 522 ticks** and
//! diverges by metres, and against a human ghost's own recorded path a resume
//! at race -0.030 is 5.578 m out where a resume at race +0.140 is 0.0055 m.
//!
//! That is fine for a search — candidates are compared with each other at one
//! fixed checkpoint — and it is wrong for regenerating telemetry, which is why
//! `fk regen` does not use this path. If you want the clean run, that is
//! `fk regen`'s recorder: fork only to LOCATE, then let the parent simulate the
//! whole tape.
//!
//! # Nothing here is hardcoded
//!
//! The server's heap layout is bimodal run to run — two identical runs can
//! differ by 87 MB — so every address is re-derived at each server start, by
//! value. Five consecutive runs gave five different addresses and
//! byte-identical CSVs.
