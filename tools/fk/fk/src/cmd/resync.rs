//! `fk resync` — put a recording's own tape back on its own recorded line.
//!
//! WHY (arm `ksi2`, 134672, 2026-08-22)
//! ------------------------------------
//! A recording made on an older game build can fail to replay on the current
//! one. The project's standing reading of that is "the run is lost": ten of
//! 134672's fifteen records DNF, including the 63.546 world record, and every
//! bound on that map has been computed from the five that survive.
//!
//! Measured, that reading is too pessimistic in a specific and useful way.
//! `fk trace` plus a lag-scanned comparison against the file's own telemetry
//! says the world record's tape is **bit-faithful for the first four seconds**
//! — 0.0003 m, the same floor a current-build recording holds for its whole
//! lap — and then a 5.6 cm error appears at race 4.06 and amplifies with an
//! e-folding time of about 1.5 s. All six of the old ghosts that could be
//! measured depart in the same 0.25 s window, at the onset of the lap's first
//! big slide.
//!
//! A divergence that is BORN at one instant is a seed, and a seed can be
//! cancelled: there may exist a small input correction, applied near it, that
//! puts the car back on the line the recording says it drove. That is what
//! this command searches for. If it works the run is recovered; if it does
//! not, and the control below says the instrument is sound, then the old
//! build's physics really are not ours and every old time on the map — the
//! author time included — belongs to a different game.
//!
//! Either way it is an answer, which is why the command reports the control
//! and the null in the same breath.
//!
//! ## The control, which is not optional
//!
//! `--control` runs the identical procedure on a tape that is known to track
//! its own recording, after deliberately breaking it by one steering unit at
//! one tick. The repair must recover it. A failure to repair the real subject
//! means nothing unless the same machinery, same budget, same seed, recovers a
//! break we made ourselves.
//!
//! ## What it is scored on
//!
//! The **sync horizon**: the race time at which the engine's own run of the
//! candidate tape first leaves the reference line by more than `--tol`. Not
//! finish time, not mean error — a mean is dominated by whatever happens after
//! the run is already lost, and finish time is unavailable for a tape that
//! never finishes. The horizon is monotone in exactly the thing being bought.
