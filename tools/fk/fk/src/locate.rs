//! locate2 -- CLOCK-FIRST location of the car's state, and why the old one
//! could not be fixed in place.
//!
//! THE DEFECT (measured on 284238 `YOU LOVE WATER`, 2026-08-19)
//! -----------------------------------------------------------
//! Both existing locators label a sample by its INDEX in the stream:
//! `sample i == tick probe-1+i`. That is only true if the child emits exactly
//! one sample per tick, and the child emits one sample per *change of the
//! deduplication key*:
//!
//!   * `traj::qualify` keys on the 12-byte POSITION. A tick in which the car
//!     does not move -- a respawn freeze, a standstill, a countdown -- emits
//!     NOTHING, and every sample after it is mislabelled by one tick. The
//!     record on this map has 31 respawns: 43 098 ticks produced 40 055
//!     samples, the labels slid by 3 000 ticks, and the live slot came back
//!     166 m from the reference path. Ten position-shaped addresses were
//!     found; not one "tracked", so the tool aborted with
//!     "no address tracks the reference ghost's path".
//!   * `blind::qualify_blind_window` keys on the 24-byte pos+vel window, and
//!     has the mirror-image problem: the engine writes that window SEVERAL
//!     times inside one tick, so consecutive samples can be 0 ms apart while
//!     the code divides by 10 ms. The velocity cross-check then reports a
//!     self-consistency error of the order of the car's speed -- 7.34 and
//!     9.26 m/s on this map, against a hard "refusing to guess" limit of 5.0.
//!
//! Both failures look like "the state is not there" and are really "the state
//! is there and the clock says so".
//!
//! THE FIX
//! -------
//! Find the RACE CLOCK first, then put it in every sampled record and key the
//! deduplication on the whole record. The clock changes every tick, so a tick
//! can never be dropped; several samples inside one tick are grouped by clock
//! value and the LAST is kept -- the same rule `decode_rows` already uses for
//! the production trajectory, which is the rule validated to 3.4 mm.
//!
//! The clock itself is found without any reference: at the checkpoint the
//! parent is paused, so a value scan of its writable memory for u32 slots near
//! the known race time gives a few hundred candidates, and the +10-every-tick
//! signature settles it. Nothing here assumes a distance from the input array
//! (that guess is only used to ORDER the search), nothing assumes the clock is
//! below the state, and no threshold is calibrated to one car's top speed.
//!
//! Three more things this fixes as a consequence:
//!   * a per-probe SIMULATED-TIME BUDGET: a locate probe wants 6 or 150 ticks
//!     and used to simulate the whole remaining tape (43 000 ticks here, 5.5
//!     minutes per attempt);
//!   * the acceptance statistic is the MEDIAN of |d(pos)/dt - v|, not the mean,
//!     so one landing impact inside the window cannot condemn the true slot;
//!   * the quaternion is checked at locate time (|q| = 1 is an independent
//!     structural signature the blind locator never used).
