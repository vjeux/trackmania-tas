//! The tape, as the ENGINE sees it: three arrays of per-tick inputs.
//!
//! # This is the only file in `fk` that knows a file format exists
//!
//! Everything else in this crate takes `&[u8]` steer / accel / brake and a
//! `start_offset_ms`. That is deliberate. `fk` used to carry its own copy of
//! the `0x0309201D` input codec (`tmsearch::ghost::Factory`), which made two
//! implementations of one bit-packed format in one project — and two
//! implementations of one file format is how this project got silent
//! corruption before. The codec lives in `ghost` now and this module is the
//! adapter.
//!
//! # What moving to `ghost`'s codec fixed
//!
//! The old `Factory` re-encoded the archive with explicit vehicle fields so
//! individual ticks could be patched in place — **except** mode-12 packets
//! carrying the "same as the previous tick" bit, which it emitted as a one-bit
//! `Slot::FROZEN` and could not patch at all. A write to such a tick was
//! silently dropped. Template `seed_rank10000` has three (ticks 0, 1, 2); they
//! sat below every resume boundary, so the defect never bit, and nothing would
//! have said so if it had.
//!
//! (The codec calls the type `SAME_INPUTS`, never "frozen": "frozen" reads as a
//! claim about the game, and a stretch of them then looks like a physics
//! constraint rather than a gap in the encoder.)
//!
//! `ghost`'s writer expands every such packet, so every tick of a tape written
//! through here is writable. `tests/suite.rs` pins it.
