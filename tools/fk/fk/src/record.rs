//! `fk clean` -- record a whole run's per-tick state from the PARENT process.
//!
//! WHY NOT A FORK
//! --------------
//! Every trajectory tool here so far resumes the simulation in a forked child.
//! That is right for a search (candidates are compared with each other at one
//! fixed checkpoint) and wrong for regenerating telemetry, because the resumed
//! run is not the clean run: measured on this engine, the same tape resumed at
//! two different checkpoints agrees on 0 of 522 ticks and diverges by metres,
//! and against a human ghost's own recorded path a resume at race -30 ms is
//! 5.578 m out where a resume at race +140 ms is 0.0055 m.
//!
//! So: fork only to LOCATE (a child cannot touch the parent's memory), then
//! hand the addresses back to the parent and let it run to the end of the tape
//! as an ordinary `/validatepath` run, writing one record per 50 ms grid
//! instant. The finish time it prints is the re-verification of the very run
//! whose telemetry was recorded.

///
/// This used to be eight positional parameters, which was survivable while
/// `regen` was the only caller. It is not survivable now that a second caller
/// needs two of the decisions made differently, because those two decisions are
/// exactly the ones that go wrong quietly:
///
/// * **`dedup`** bounds what reaches the disk. The shim emits a record on every
///   `lroundf` call whose gathered key slice differs from the last, so a WIDE
///   gather deduplicated on the whole record never suppresses anything —
///   something in 320 KB of engine memory changes on every call. Measured: a
///   320 KB window at a 50 ms grid wrote **9.8 GB in two minutes** and was still
///   going. Keying the dedup on the production window alone restores the
///   production semantics (one record per distinct vehicle state) and the extra
///   ground rides along for free.
/// * **`choose_copy`** decides whether the gathered record is searched for the
///   live copy of the car. That search is right when the window is 452 bytes of
///   vehicle state and catastrophic when it is 320 KB of anything: on the first
///   wide run it walked off the car and the self-check reported
///   `|q|-1 p99.5 = 1.34e-1`. A caller that has ALREADY chosen the car — by
///   running a narrow gather first and taking [`CleanOut::pos`] — must be able

// NEUTRALISING THE CARRIER'S OWN BYTES
//
// A regenerated ghost writes the 22 transform bytes (47..69) from engine state
// and the three input-echo bytes (14, 15, 18) from the tape. Everything else in
// the 116-byte sample is still the CARRIER's -- rpm, gear, wheel rotation,
// suspension, surface effects, turbo. On a file grafted into somebody else's
// container those bytes are a stranger's, and the file is quietly part-carrier:
// it re-simulates to the exact millisecond and it is sub-millimetre where it was
// written.
//
// There were two ways out and this project tried the harder one first.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND THEN DELETED. `fk fields` swept the whole writable
// address space against a real ghost's own recorded columns; `fk fit` turned
// "this slot correlates with rpm" into an encoding; `fk probe` printed the
// near misses; `fk whl` found the four-wheel rotation block (four f32 at
// stride 44, each accumulating distance / one shared radius, |corr| > 0.9999)
// so the offsets would be a property of the GAME rather than of the run --
// which mattered, because two runs of the same map land on different copies of
// the car state and an offset from the position anchor reproduced rpm on 0.2%
// of samples on a second map. It worked: sample byte 5 is
// `round(0.008489 * slot@pos-240812)`, exact on 439 of 474 recorded samples and
// within one quantisation step on all 474.
//
// None of it is on a live path. Every production recipe in this project runs
// `--fieldmap none` or a "neutral map" that is nothing but a list of byte
// offsets to zero, so ~3,300 lines were maintained to produce encodings nobody
// wrote. The 3,300 lines are deleted; the measurements above are the record.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT is the honest option: zero the per-run bytes we do not write, so
// no per-run byte of the donor survives, and say so. Byte 89 (ground contact)
// and byte 31 bit 7 (reactor) were withdrawn as unreliable and are zeroed with
// the rest. `tmtraj check` C10 fails on every neutralised file for exactly this
// reason, and that is sanctioned rather than fixed.
//
// The offsets NOT in this list are format constants (51, 80, 255, 240, 15, 0)
// that are identical in every ghost of every driver, so leaving them alone
// carries no provenance.

// The list and the writer live in `gbx::record` -- `tmtraj` has to RECOGNISE
// a neutralised record to tell a removed field from a stolen one, and two
