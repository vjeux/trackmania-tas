//! The finishing pass: everything between "the engine state is in the record"
//! and "this file is publishable".
//!
//! It exists because the list of things that had to be remembered was longer
//! than anyone remembered it, and every item on it shipped at least once:
//!
//! | shipped defect | what was forgotten |
//! |---|---|
//! | dirt thrown where there is no dirt | the 49 unwritten per-run bytes |
//! | a 441 s clip of a 218 s run, camera adrift | the record's inherited span |
//! | a header declaring the donor's time | the declared-time census |
//! | a stranger's login, badge, country, uuid | the identity fields |
//!
//! Every one was found by a person noticing something odd in a video, days
//! later. So the fix is not another check that somebody has to run: it is that
//! `ghost regen`'s DEFAULT output is finished, and that it refuses rather than
//! writing something a later step has to catch.
//!
//! Each step below already existed as a separate command that had to be run
//! afterwards by whoever knew to. They are called here, in order, on every
//! regeneration — `ghost record rebuild`, `ghost declare --from-oracle`,
//! `ghost identity --anonymise` — and each one still refuses on its own terms,
//! which is what makes calling them a pipeline rather than a copy of them.
