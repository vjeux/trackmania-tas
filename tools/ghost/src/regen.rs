//! `ghost regen` -- from INPUTS + MAP, generate the car state and write it into
//! the ghost, so the recorded trajectory matches the tape.
//!
//! This is the operation that keeps biting the project, and it bites in a
//! specific way: the state reader locates the car in a live engine's memory,
//! and WHICH COPY it lands on varies between runs. A wrong pick produces a
//! file that passes coverage, passes a manifest, passes a two-run agreement
//! test, and carries a frozen memory slot instead of a car.
//!
//! So this wrapper does not just call the regenerator. It runs it, then puts
//! the result through a gate that can IDENTIFY the answer rather than count
//! votes:
//!
//!   G1  the written file's own telemetry agrees with the tape it carries
//!       (the two input channels in one file, no reference needed);
//!   G2  the first sample is at the map's spawn, not somewhere else;
//!   G3  the path length is a plausible driven distance, not 0 m and not 1e28;
//!   G4  the plain oracle re-simulates THE WRITTEN FILE to the declared time;
//!   G5  no sample is NaN and no position is constant for the whole run.
//!
//! and `ghost regen-control` runs the strongest control the write path has: a
//! ghost that already carries its own true telemetry, regenerated from its own
//! inputs, must reproduce that telemetry. If the fixed point does not hold on a
//! known-good file, nothing the regenerator says about an unknown one counts.

    // fields are asked for this path is skipped rather than run without them.
    // ALWAYS true: the carrier is unconditional now (the flag was removed), so
    // the in-process path must always be skipped. Reading the user flag here
    // after deleting it silently disabled the field gather -- regen then ran
