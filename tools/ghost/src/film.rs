//! `ghost film` -- ONE COMMAND from a search tape to a file the CLIENT WILL LOAD.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. Every step below was already available, and getting a tape
//! onto the render box still took half an hour of fiddling, four failed
//! renders and two published clips that showed the WRONG CAR. The knowledge
//! was spread over `record rebuild`, `regen`, `record ents`, `record
//! graft-scene`, `record entorder` and `trim`, and each one has a trap that is
//! invisible until a human watches the video:
//!
//!   1. `regen` SILENTLY KEEPS THE DONOR'S TELEMETRY whenever the donor record
//!      covers the new grid -- which, when the lap is shorter than its carrier,
//!      is always. You get V5 PASS and V6 kappa 0.457: it looks like success
//!      and it renders somebody else's driving. The strip must come first.
//!   2. ...but `record rebuild` DROPS the zero-sample `0x032CB000` placeholder
//!      that carries the checkpoint blocks, and the client HARD-CRASHES on the
//!      entity layout that leaves behind. So the scene has to be grafted back.
//!   3. `--car-last` is not an absolute index. Last-of-3 is index 2; a client
//!      that wants 3-of-4 refuses it. The reference file decides, not a flag.
//!   4. A record that RUNS PAST ITS DECLARED TIME is soft-rejected: `0 -> 0`
//!      ghost blocks, dialog `FrameMessage`, no crash, no error, nothing in
//!      the log that says why. This one cost the most.
//!
//! None of those four is checked by `ghost verify`. A tape can pass all eleven
//! gates at kappa 1.000 and still be unloadable, which is why the only honest
//! test is a REFERENCE FILE THE CLIENT IS KNOWN TO ACCEPT -- this command
//! takes one and matches the container to it.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   ghost film IN OUT --map MAP --ref ACCEPTED [--span MS] [--expect-dnf]
//!                     [--spawn-ref GHOST] [--keep-scratch]
//!
//! `--ref` is the load-bearing argument: a ghost of this map that the client
//! has actually imported. Its entity list is the specification.
