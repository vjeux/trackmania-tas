/// a donor carries the DONOR's telemetry, and no positional check can see that
/// -- but these two channels stop agreeing immediately, and comparing them
/// needs no reference file at all.
///
/// The statistic is COHEN'S KAPPA on the exact byte, not a raw hit rate, and
/// the difference matters: a bang-bang keyboard tape sits at three steer values
/// for most of a run, so two UNRELATED runs of it agree on 40 % of samples by
/// chance alone, and a raw rate cannot tell that from a real recording. Kappa
/// divides out that chance agreement -- `(p_obs - p_chance) / (1 - p_chance)`
/// with `p_chance` computed from each channel's own marginals -- so a genuine
/// recording scores near 1 and a foreign one scores near 0 whatever the tape
/// looks like.

/// Byte 14 is `floor((steer_i8 + 127) * 255 / 254)`, measured against the whole

    // of every reference ghost in this corpus), the list does not go backwards,
    // and no intermediate sits at or past the finish.
    //
    // ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A PASS. **These checks cannot detect the one
    // defect that has actually shipped here — a split table INHERITED from the
    // donor.** 287431's whole lineage is seeded from ITZYNO1FAN's 24.092 ghost;
    // every tape it produced declared his six splits beside its own finish, and
    // that table is monotonic, ends at the declared time, and sits entirely
    // inside the run. It passes all three checks below and is somebody else's
    // measurement. A published clip said "CP6 at 16.945" on that basis.
    //
    // Nor can the trajectory settle it. The obvious gate -- "was the car near
    // checkpoint k at split k" -- was built and MEASURED on this map before
    // being rejected: our line tracks his to about 2 m through CP4, so at his
    // split times our car is 1.2 / 2.9 / 2.4 / 2.6 m from his position, well
    // inside the 20-46 m that a checkpoint block's ORIGIN sits from its own
    // gate. Every one of the six passes. A test any outcome satisfies is
    // decoration, so it is not here.
    //
    // WHERE THE DEFECT IS CAUGHT INSTEAD: `ghost declare`, which is the only
    // place that sees the run BEFORE and AFTER. When the declared time changes,
    // the intermediates timed the old run and are zeroed. Hence the zero rule
    // below -- a blank table is the honest state, not a broken one.
