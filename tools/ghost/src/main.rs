const HELP: &str = r#"ghost -- the TM2020 ghost / replay API

  Every command that WRITES a file runs a control first and refuses rather than
  writing something that would be silently wrong. Times print as seconds.

INSPECT
  ghost inspect FILE [--ticks]
        Everything the file says about itself: container kind, the map it will
        actually run on, declared time and every copy of it, splits, identity,
        the input tape, and the telemetry record.
  ghost chunks FILE
        The skippable-chunk table, for forensics.
  ghost manifest FILE
  ghost manifest diff LEFT RIGHT
        Deterministic JSON: GBX header/chunks, packet-mode histogram and payload
        shapes, full record grammar, and the first controlled-car sample.

INPUTS  (operation 1 and 2)
  ghost tape extract FILE --out TAPE.gtape
        Full fidelity: every tick, every field the packet carries -- state word,
        respawn bit, mouse axes, steer / accel / brake, trigger fields, mode and
        flags. Round-trips byte-for-byte.
  ghost tape inject IN OUT --tape TAPE.gtape [--verbatim] [--allow-telemetry-mismatch]
        Write a tape back into a ghost. Default writes every vehicle field
        EXPLICITLY so no tick inherits the previous one's inputs; --verbatim
        reproduces the file's original coding exactly.
  ghost tape expand IN OUT [--state]
        Rewrite every "same as the previous tick" packet in its explicit form.
        Semantically a no-op -- and the oracle control says so -- but afterwards
        every tick is writable.
  ghost tape diff A.gtape B.gtape
        Per-tick differences between two tapes.
  ghost tape poke IN --out T.gtape --ticks A..B --set steer=..,accel=..,brake=..
        Override the vehicle inputs over a half-open tick range and leave every
        other tick identical: the one-variable probe -- a brake pulse, a lifted
        throttle, a unit of steer -- without hand-editing `t=` lines, where an
        off-by-one is invisible and lands in a measurement.
  ghost tape stats TAPE.gtape
        Tick count, input events, packet modes, respawns.
  ghost tape csv FILE|TAPE.gtape [--out F.csv] [--from MS] [--to MS]
        The tape as `race_ms,steer,accel,brake`, one row a tick -- the format
        every map page publishes under `inputs/`. Those files had no writer in
        the repo, so a page's inputs could not be regenerated from the ghost
        they came from, or checked against it.
  ghost tape bits FILE... [--events]
        Which bits of the state literal actually vary across a corpus; --events
        also prints each explicit literal's tick and decoded state, never inputs.

CAR STATE  (operation 3)
  ghost regen IN OUT --map MAP [--anchorticks a,b,c] [--noanchor]
        Run the real engine on this file's own inputs, capture per-sample car
        state and write it into the ghost, so the recorded trajectory MATCHES
        the tape. Refuses unless the acceptance gate passes.
        Every sample byte the engine can source is AUTHORED, from the game's
        own writer transcribed at 0x9cfed0: the transform, and the 94 other
        bytes (speed, rpm, the four wheels, gear, dampers, ground contact, the
        reactor). 11 channels the dedicated server cannot source stay the
        carrier's and the run names them; `ghost record countdown` authors four
        more of those from the file's own race clock.
        There is no flag for any of this. `--neutralise`, `--inputs`,
        `--trim-outside` and `--carrier` are UNCONDITIONAL and are not options:
        passing them changes nothing and there is no run without them. That
        cost a day on 287431 -- `--neutralise` was tested on and off, the two
        outputs were byte-identical (md5 b9a8bc3a...), and the byte hypothesis
        was eliminated on the strength of a flag that was already on. A regen
        without the carrier draws the car as a TRANSPARENT WIREFRAME in the
        game client while gating at V1-V11 and kappa 1.000; three clips shipped
        that way before anyone looked at a frame.
        --spawn-ref FILE names the recording G2 checks the start against, for a
        template whose own record is a rebuilt grid (a constant identifies
        nothing, and G2 says UNMEASURED rather than passing).
  ghost roundtrip GHOST --map MAP [--bar MM] [--keep]
        The end-to-end control: regenerate a recording the game itself wrote,
        from its own inputs, and require its own trajectory back. The answer key
        is in the file and nothing about it can be tuned. Floor 0.48-0.52 mm
        (client vs dedicated server); default bar 5 mm.
  ghost regen-control FILE --map MAP
        The fixed-point control: regenerate a ghost that already carries its own
        true telemetry and require the result to reproduce it.

MAP  (operation 4)
  ghost map show FILE
        Which map this file will actually run on -- and whether --map is real
        for it at all.
  ghost map extract FILE --out MAP.Map.Gbx
  ghost map set IN OUT --map MAP.Map.Gbx
        Replace the CARRIED map. This is the only thing that moves a recording
        onto another map: rewriting the uid does not.

TRIM  (operation 5)
  ghost trim IN OUT [--from MS] [--to MS] [--declare MS]
        Set the run's WINDOW, in race-time milliseconds. Cut the head and/or
        the tail, keeping the file coherent: inputs, telemetry samples, the
        record span, the splits and every copy of the declared time. A --to
        PAST the end of the tape LENGTHENS it instead, appending ticks that
        hold the last recorded input -- room for the car to keep driving after
        the recording stopped. One command owns a run's length in both
        directions.

RECORD
  ghost record chain FILE
        Which entity is the DRIVER, on a record that holds more than one car:
        every tiling chain and the path each one drove. The stock reader takes
        the `CSceneVehicleVis` entity with the MOST SAMPLES, which is right on a
        solo ghost and wrong on a server recording -- there the driver's car is
        destroyed and recreated at every respawn, so the driver is 46 short
        entities tiling the race and the longest single entity is another
        player. Path length is what separates them: a spectator car parked at
        the spawn tiles perfectly for the whole race and travels zero metres.

SPLICE  (operation 5b -- the MIDDLE of a run, where trim owns the two ends)
  ghost splice IN OUT [--rule retries] [--drop A..B,...] [--keep-record]
                      [--map MAP] [--server DIR]
        Delete whole intervals out of the middle of a run and CLOSE THE GAP:
        the tape, the telemetry, the splits and every copy of the declared time
        are retimed together. `--rule retries` derives the intervals from the
        file itself -- for every checkpoint segment that contains a respawn
        press, delete that segment from its start through its LAST respawn
        press, i.e. every failed attempt, keeping the one that reached the
        checkpoint. Nothing else is cut and no surviving tick is edited, so the
        new time is exactly `finish - 10 ms x deleted ticks` and the file
        carries ZERO respawn ticks (the gate asserts it).
        --drop deletes extra intervals given in the ORIGINAL file's race ms;
        that is how a de-looped artefact is built, from a loop census the
        caller has to state.
        A SPLICE IS NOT A LAP. The car's state jumps at every junction; the
        command measures each jump off the file's own recording and prints it,
        and the oracle is not expected to return the declared time.

DECLARE
  ghost declare IN OUT (--time MS | --from-oracle --map M) [--splits MS,MS,...] [--cps N]
        Set the time the file DECLARES, in every copy of it, and in the
        ghost-result chunk. --cps N also sets the NUMBER of checkpoint entries,
        which a container borrowed from another map gets wrong: it declares the
        DONOR map's checkpoint list. MEASURED, so that nobody re-derives it from
        the tool: the dedicated server does NOT gate on this count -- a file
        declaring 1, 2, 3, 5 or 9 checkpoints on a 4-checkpoint map still
        validates, and the mismatch shows up only as ValidatedResult and
        DeclaredResult disagreeing. What the count breaks is THIS toolchain:
        `tmmaps` refuses to build a segment map against a ghost whose split
        count is not the map's, because every rung would be verified against
        the wrong checkpoint.

IDENTITY  (operation 6)
  ghost identity show FILE
  ghost identity set IN OUT [--name N] [--trigram XXX] [--skin PATH|default]
                            [--login L] [--zone Z] [--clubtag T] [--anonymise]
                            [--pad-ids] [--allow-noop]
        Car skin, display name and 3-letter trigram. --anonymise also drops the
        account id and the storage locator URL, which are the two foreign
        identifiers a strip-list usually misses -- AND the driver block in the
        replay header and in body chunk 0x03093018, which are the two a
        body-only anonymiser misses. --pad-ids keeps the old behaviour of
        padding an unresizable id to `xxxx...` instead of removing it.
        --allow-noop writes the output even when nothing in the body needed
        changing, for a caller that wants the STATE (this file is anonymous)
        rather than the EDIT. By hand that case is almost always the wrong
        file, so without the flag it still refuses.
  ghost header show FILE
        The replay HEADER: its chunk table, the driver fields, the map's own
        attribution (which stays), and every copy of the race time the header
        holds -- the copies the body census cannot see. A plain .Ghost.Gbx has
        no replay header and says so.

VERIFY
  ghost verify FILE [--map MAP] [--expect-ms MS] [--server DIR]
        The acceptance gate: codec identity, tape/telemetry agreement, declared
        time census, container identity, and the plain oracle re-simulating THE
        WRITTEN FILE.
  ghost selftest [--server DIR] [--data DIR]
        The whole test suite, from one command.
