//! THE SAVESTATE TREE: driver side.
//!
//! # What a tree node is
//!
//! The classic fork server has one fork point. Every candidate is a child that
//! rewrites the tail of the input array, runs to the finish, prints a time and
//! dies. Anything the child learned on the way is lost, so reaching a state
//! 2000 ticks in costs a full re-simulation of those 2000 ticks, every time.
//!
//! A **node** is a fork child that stops after a few ticks and re-enters the
//! fork server itself, on a socket of its own. It is a savestate: a paused
//! simulation that can be forked again. A search over macros then pays the
//! macro, not the prefix.
//!
//! # The three things that make this safe rather than merely fast
//!
//! 1. **Every node probes its own consumed boundary.** The `lroundf` checkpoint
//!    is not a fixed simulation point -- under load it moves in whole chunks of
//!    ~62 calls -- so where a node stopped is a property of that node and of
//!    nothing else. A node whose probe fails is destroyed, never used with an
//!    assumed boundary. (`tm2020-forkserver.md`: a failed probe is a hard
//!    abort, never a fallback.)
//! 2. **`branch` refuses to write at or below that boundary.** A record the
//!    engine has already consumed cannot be un-consumed; rewriting it is a
//!    silent no-op that scores exactly the parent's score, so the mutation
//!    disappears and the lineage is contaminated for free. That is defect 1 of
//!    `tm2020-phantoms.md` and it is the reason this module exists. The refusal
//!    is here, at the lowest level that knows the boundary, and it is not
//!    optional.
//! 3. **Calibration may only push the boundary LATER, never earlier.** A caller
//!    that has its own estimate combines it as `max(estimate, probe + 1)`, never
//!    `min`. `Node::floor` does that arithmetic so no caller has to remember it.
//!
//! # Why a unix socket
//!
//! A branch child inherits its parent's command pipe. If it served that pipe,
//! two processes would race for every command byte and the loser would
//! eventually execute a command assembled from the middle of somebody else's
//! patch payload. So the node gets fresh descriptors: it connects to a listener
//! the driver owns, and the driver matches the connection to the branch it
//! asked for **by the pid the node names in its own handshake**.
