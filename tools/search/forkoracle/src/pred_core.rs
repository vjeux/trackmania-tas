//! The predicate core: one copy of the condition language, shared verbatim by
//! the LD_PRELOAD shim (where it runs INSIDE the fork child, once per tick) and
//! by the `fk` driver (where it parses the command line, builds the wire
//! config, and re-evaluates the very same conditions offline against a
//! trajectory CSV).
//!
//! It is included by both crates with `#[path = ...] mod`, not linked as a
//! library, for one reason: `fkshim` is a `cdylib` that exports `lroundf`, and
//! linking it into `fk` would interpose the hook on the driver itself. A shared
//! source file gives one implementation with no linkage risk.
//!
//! # Rules the child imposes on this code
//!
//! * **No allocation, no syscalls, no panics on the hot path.** Everything is
//!   fixed-size: the evaluator is a `static` in the child, the ring buffers are
//!   arrays, the reference trajectory is a raw pointer into memory the parent
//!   leaked before the first fork (so every child inherits it copy-on-write and
//!   nobody pays to copy it).
//! * **No `std::fmt`, no `Vec`, in anything reachable from `feed`.**
//! * The evaluator may only READ the simulation's memory. A watchdog that
//!   perturbs the physics is worse than no watchdog at all.

// integers -- `-vz`, body-lateral speed, `min(|side|, 5*-vz)`, a signed
// distance to a 6-D target state, and so on -- each one a match arm added to
// the child the day it was wanted. Two of them turned out to be decoys and one
// was a sign error; none of them could be tried without rebuilding the shim
// that runs inside the game server.
//
// So the key is compiled in the parent from an expression the operator writes
// (`min(abs(bodyright), 5*(-vz))`) into a fixed-size postfix program, and the
// child runs that program on a tiny stack. No allocation, no branching on
// strings, nothing to add to this file the next time a map wants a different
// quantity. The parser is `crate::pred::parse_key`, in the driver, where it can
// have a tokenizer and an error message; this side only executes.

/// Most operations one key may have. A program that does not fit is refused by
