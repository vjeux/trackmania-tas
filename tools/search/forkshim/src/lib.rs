//! fkshim -- LD_PRELOAD fork server for the TM2020 dedicated server.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! The server simulates a ghost's input tape tick by tick. Re-simulating from
//! tick 0 for every candidate wastes the whole shared prefix. This shim stops
//! the process *inside* the simulation, holds that state as a checkpoint, and
//! forks a child per candidate: the child rewrites the still-unread part of the
//! decoded input array and runs only the tail.
//!
//! # The three mechanisms
//!
//! 1. **A deterministic clock.** The engine calls `lroundf` ~25.5 times per
//!    simulated millisecond, and the total for a given (map, ghost) is bit-exact
//!    across runs. Interposing it gives a reproducible cursor into the middle of
//!    a simulation with no debugger, no disassembly and no ptrace.
//!
//! 2. **The decoded input array.** The ghost's bitstream is decoded up front (it
//!    is *not* read during the simulation) into one 32-byte record per 10 ms
//!    tick: `f32 steer = (i8)steer/127`, `f32 gas`, `f32 brake`, then engine
//!    fields. The shim finds it by searching its own address space for the
//!    reference ghost's steer sequence at stride 32.
//!
//! 3. **fork() from the checkpoint.** The engine simulates on the main thread
//!    (the only other thread, `NetPoll`, sleeps), so the fork child is a
//!    complete, self-consistent simulator. The parent never advances.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! Driven over two inherited fds (`FKSHIM_CMD_FD`, `FKSHIM_RES_FD`). Frames are
//! `u32 len` + payload. The shim announces `READY <base> <clock>`, then serves
//! commands until `Q`:
//!   `R <n> [tick steer gas brake]*n`  -- fork, patch, run, return the child's
//!                                        stdout (the validator's JSON block)

// --------------------------------------------------------------- the BRANCH
//
// THE SAVESTATE TREE. A fork child normally runs the tape to the end and dies;
// everything it learned along the way dies with it, so every node of a search
// has to be reached by re-simulating its whole prefix from the one checkpoint
// the parent holds.
//
// A branch child instead simulates a FEW ticks and then re-enters the fork
// server itself, becoming a new fork point. The three things that stopped it
// from doing that, all in code we own:
//
//  1. `IS_CHILD` -- set by every child so it can never re-enter. A branch child
//     needs to re-enter exactly once, so `BRANCH_ARMED` licenses that one
//     re-entry and is consumed on the way in.
//  2. `ARMED` -- the one-shot latch on the checkpoint test. Reset in the branch
//     child so the NEXT checkpoint fires.
//  3. **The two inherited fds.** A child that served the parent's `cmd`/`res`
//     pipes would race the parent for every command byte. So a branch child
//     gets FRESH fds: it connects to a unix socket the driver is listening on,
//     and serves the same protocol down that one socket (the frame code does
//     not care that read and write are the same descriptor).
//
// A branch child also caches what the first entry already worked out. The
// entry path Horspool-scans every `rw` mapping of a 150 MB address space to
// find the decoded input array; repeating that per node would put the scan on
// the hot path. The array does not move (it is decoded once, before the
// simulation, and there is exactly one copy), and the child is a fork of the
// process that found it, so the address is still good -- but "still good" is a
// claim, so the branch VERIFIES the cached base against the key rather than
// trusting it, and a mismatch is a hard abort.

// the vehicle struct out to a dedicated pipe.

// STOP SIMULATING A CANDIDATE THE MOMENT IT IS CLEARLY DEAD.
//
// Cost is linear in simulated time, and a third to a half of the candidates a
// search generates crash, stop or leave the track long before the finish. The
// state needed to notice that is already in hand -- `do_sample` above proves
// the child can read the car's position and velocity every tick for a couple
// of milliseconds -- so the condition costs almost nothing to evaluate and the
// saving is the whole remaining tail.
//
// Three properties are non-negotiable:
//
//  1. A candidate that does NOT trip must produce a bit-identical answer to
//     one run with no watchdog. The evaluator therefore only ever READS the
//     simulation's memory, never allocates (the `Eval` is a `static`, the
//     reference line is memory the parent leaked before the first fork), and
//     never makes a syscall until it decides to abort.
//  2. Per-tick semantics must match `decode_rows` in the driver exactly: the
//     record is deduplicated on its whole content, and a tick is evaluated
//     when the RACE CLOCK moves on, using the last record carrying the old
//     clock. That is the same "last sample per clock value" rule the CSV path
//     uses, which is the rule that was validated to 3.4 mm.
//  3. The parent has to learn what happened even though the child exits
//     without printing anything. A one-page MAP_SHARED region carries the
//     summary out; the child updates it every tick, so the parent can read
//     progress even for candidates that ran to the end.

// THE BOOT IS NOT THE SLEEPING, THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE IT. Measured, and left
// here so it is not re-derived:
//
//   strace -c on a bare boot: clock_nanosleep 69.96% of syscall time, 273
//   calls, and summing the wall time of each gives 2.74 s inside a 2.24 s
//   boot -- more than the boot itself, because they are concurrent IDLE
//   threads, not the critical path.
//
// An LD_PRELOAD interceptor for `nanosleep` (the symbol the binary actually
// imports -- `objdump -T` shows `nanosleep`, while strace reports both under
// one name) DOES bind: with the shim loaded, strace counts ZERO sleep calls.
// The boot still takes 2.24 s. So the sleeps cost nothing and the boot's real
// cost is elsewhere -- most likely the 27,174 FAILING stat calls and the
// engine's own start-up work. Interception was the right instinct and the
// wrong target.
